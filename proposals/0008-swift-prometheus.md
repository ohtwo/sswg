## Introduction

_For a background on_ [_`swift-metrics`_](https://github.com/apple/swift-metrics) _see the metrics_ [_proposal discussion_](https://forums.swift.org/t/discussion-server-metrics-api/19600) _and_ [_feedback_](https://forums.swift.org/t/feedback-server-metrics-api/21353) _threads._

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) is a service that scrapes metrics from other services, and stores them in a time series database to be queried and alerted upon. SwiftPrometheus is a client-side library to allow packages to export metrics in the [Prometheus format](https://openmetrics.io) in Swift, with the ability to use it both connected to & separately from swift-metrics.

## Motivation

With Prometheus being one of the most widely used metric reporting tools, as well as a [graduated project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/announcement/2018/08/09/prometheus-graduates/), it's a cornerstone that can not be left out in a serverside ecosystem. This package is created for everyone to use & build upon for their metric reporting.

## Detailed design

`SwiftPrometheus` is a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) client implementation, conforming to the `SwiftMetrics` API. It centers around the `PrometheusClient` class, and provides various metric types.

Swift _libraries_ should depend upon and use the generic `SwiftMetrics` API, in order to not force end-users down the path of using a specific backend. Swift _applications_ though should bootstrap the `PrometheusClient` and use the `SwiftMetrics` API _when practical_, yet are free to use the `PrometheusClient` directly as well â€“ as an application does not need to concern itself with its consumers being "locked into" a specific backend. The [Prometheus metric types](https://www.prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/) are:

* Counter - A  _counter_  is a cumulative metric that represents a single [monotonically increasing counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function) whose value can only increase or be reset to zero on restart.
* Gauge - A  _gauge_  is a metric that represents a single numerical value that can arbitrarily go up and down.
* Histogram - A  _histogram_  samples observations \(usually things like request durations or response sizes\) and counts them in configurable buckets. It also provides a sum of all observed values.
* Summary - Similar to a  _histogram_ , a  _summary_  samples observations \(usually things like request durations and response sizes\). While it also provides a total count of observations and a sum of all observed values, it calculates configurable quantiles over a sliding time window.

SwiftPrometheus provides fully featured implementations for all of them, including a thin wrapper around them for integration with `swift-metrics`.

### API Layout

The following section describes the public API of this package and is split into two parts. The first describes the suggested pattern of integrating directly with the `swift-metrics` package. The second delves into the increased flexibility granted by directly working with Prometheus metric types, at the cost of increased lock-in.

#### With swift-metrics

For use with swift-metrics, bootstrap the MetricsSystem with an instance of `PrometheusClient`:

```swift
let myProm = PrometheusClient()
MetricsSystem.bootstrap(myProm)
```

After that, you can use the metric types used by swift-metrics for your metrics. The mapping is as follows:

| swift-metrics | SwiftPrometheus |
| :--- | :--- |
| Counter | Counter |
| Gauge | Gauge |
| Recorder \(agg\) | Histogram |
| Timer | Summary |

To get a hold of your `PrometheusClient` either to: a\) use custom prometheus behaviour; or b\) get your metrics output there is a utility function on `MetricsSystem`

```swift
let myProm = try MetricsSystem.prometheus()
```

This will either return the `PrometheusClient` used with `.bootstrap()` or throw an error if `MetricsSystem` was not bootstrapped with `PrometheusClient` _Note: There currently is no support for retrieving a `PrometheusClient` when using `MultiplexMetricsHandler`_

#### Without swift-metrics

To get started, initialise an instance of `PrometheusClient`

```swift
import Prometheus
let myProm = PrometheusClient()
```

Once done, you can use the `create*` APIs to create any of the above described metric types.

```swift
// MetricLabels is a helper type used to add labeled metrics.
struct MyCodable: MetricLabels {
   var thing: String = "*"
}

// - Counter
let counter = myProm.createCounter(forType: Int.self, named: "my_counter", helpText: "Just a counter", initialValue: 42, withLabelType: MyCodable.self)

counter.inc() // Increment by one
counter.inc(12) // Increment by a value
counter.inc(12, MyCodable(thing: "test")) // Increment a labeled counter

// - Gauge
let gauge = myProm.createGauge(forType: Int.self, named: "my_gauge", helpText: "Just a gauge", initialValue: 42, withLabelType: MyCodable.self)
gauge.inc() // Same APIs as Counter
gauge.dec() // Same APIs as `inc()` but reversed.
gauge.set(42) // Set the gauge to a specific value

// - Histogram
// Histograms use special labels, different than the Counter & Gauge
struct HistogramLabel: HistogramLabels {
   var le: String = ""
   let route: String

   init() {
       self.route = "*"
   }

   init(_ route: String) {
       self.route = route
   }
}

let histogram = myProm.createHistogram(forType: Double.self, named: "my_histogram", helpText: "Just a histogram", labels: HistogramLabel.self)

histogram.observe(123) // Observes a value

// - Summary
// Like Histograms, Summaries use different label types.
struct SummaryLabel: SummaryLabels {
   var quantile: String = ""
   let route: String

   init() {
       self.route = "*"
   }

   init(_ route: String) {
       self.route = route
   }
}

let summary = myProm.createSummary(forType: Double.self, named: "my_summary", helpText: "Just a summary", labels: SummaryLabel.self)

summary.observe(123) // Observes a value
```

Then, after you have some metric types, you can use `.collect()` on your `PromtheusClient` to get your Prometheus formatted string with all the data. For example, in a Vapor app:

```swift
router.get("/metrics") { req -> String in 
    return myProm.collect()
}
```

## Maturity Justification

The implementation has the full feature set required for production use and meets the minimum requirements set forth by the SSWG.

## Alternatives considered

Other than using a different metrics backend than Prometheus, there are not many alternatives to consider. One thing I'd like to point out though:

This library has support for the destroying of metrics in the way set forth by the `swift-metrics` package. However, as described in the Prometheus documentation, once a metric is created with a specific type, so for example a `Counter` named `my_counter` and that counter is destroyed, it's not allowed to, at a later time, re-create a metric named `my_counter` with a DIFFERENT type. \(Creating another counter is fine\). To keep track of this, `PrometheusClient` will hold a dictionary of metric names & types. \(`[String: MetricType]`\). This means that even if you destroy your metrics, your memory footprint will \(gradually\) increase. All of this is process bound and will reset on a process restart.
